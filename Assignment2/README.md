One final note: ChatGPT was used in this project for dealing with errors specifically regarding package management and executing terminal commands as this is my first java project which I have used VS Code with.  As you may know, VS Code is much less forgiving than Eclipse therefore I spent much time debugging these IDE related errors with the assistance of ChatGPT.  I share this for the sake of transparency, as requested.
